## 7. Review Mode

Review Mode is an **AI audit** session on existing text. The AI proposes no direct modifications and does not touch the text.

### 7.1 Principle

The author switches to Review Mode from the main toolbar. The AI processes the selected text (passage, chapter or entire volume) and produces a structured report.

### 7.2 Report Contents

- Detected inconsistencies — characters, objects, timeline
- Language tics — lexical and syntactic repetitions
- Rhythm curve — tension/rest alternation across the chapter
- Narrative density — ellipsis vs detailed scene distribution
- Stylistic signals — deviations from the ingested style profile

### 7.3 Output Format

The report is exportable as `.md` or `.pdf`. No modifications are made to the source text in this mode.

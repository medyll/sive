## 3. Stylistic Mastery & Voice

### 3.1 Ingestion-Based Profiling

Learning the author's style from source files (`.md` / YAML). Profiles are stored per user and versioned.

### 3.2 Style Settings — Sliders

Slider interface to control the tone and rhythm of AI suggestions:

- **Cynicism** — from neutral to sharp
- **Syntactic complexity** — from simple to elaborate
- **Rhythm** — from staccato to flowing
- **Narrative density** — from detailed scene to temporal ellipsis

> Narrative density is often more immediately actionable than abstract sliders: it directly drives the description/action ratio in generated suggestions.

### 3.3 Flow Analysis

Detection of language tics, lexical repetitions and adherence to the author's metric. Results displayed in the **Style** tab.

### 3.4 Targeted Passage Analysis

**"Analyse this passage"** button available on any text selection. Launches a targeted stylistic analysis without continuous monitoring, preserving performance and avoiding alert fatigue.

### 3.5 Text-to-Speech

Rhythm testing via various synthesis voices (LiveKit). Allows detection of sentences that "catch" on the ear.

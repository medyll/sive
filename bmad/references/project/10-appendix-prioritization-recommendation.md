## Appendix — Prioritization Recommendation

All features below constitute the complete V1 scope. The recommendation is to tackle them in the following order to deliver value at each stage and validate key assumptions before attacking the most complex modules.

| Priority | Feature | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Resizable split editor + Focus Mode | UX foundation — nothing else works without this |
| 2 | Multi-tab right panel + AI Spinner | Feedback interface structure |
| 3 | Versioning (Harden) + Timeline + Visual diff | Author confidence — safety net before everything else |
| 4 | Review Mode (AI report) | Strong differentiator, manageable complexity |
| 5 | Style profiling + Sliders (incl. Density) | Core AI value — depends on profiling |
| 6 | Coherence engine + Physical logic | Requires false positive rate validation |
| 7 | Censorship mode / beta reader export | After YAML format stabilisation |
| 8 | Multi-user + Total isolation | In parallel once file architecture is stable |

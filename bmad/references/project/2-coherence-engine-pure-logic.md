## 2. Coherence Engine & Pure Logic

### 2.1 Inconsistency Detector

Real-time monitoring of character and object states. Alerts are displayed in the **Coherence** tab of the right panel.

### 2.2 Physical Logic Calculator — Soft Alert Mode

Verification of the feasibility of journeys, durations and physical laws referenced in the narrative. Each signal is accompanied by an explicit **confidence level** (Low / Medium / High). The author remains sovereign: signals are suggestions, never blockers.

- Example: Paris–Lyon journey estimated at 2h by car vs 30 min in the narrative → **High** signal
- Example: character wearing a winter coat in midsummer → **Medium** signal (may be intentional)

### 2.3 Ultra-Granular Categorisation Engine

Continuous tracking of ages, clothing, vehicle types and narrative chronology via the current chapter's YAML file.

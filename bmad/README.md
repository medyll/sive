BMAD Method - project scaffolding

This folder contains basic BMAD scaffolding and templates to get started with the `bmad-master` skill.

Files:
- `config.yaml` — project configuration (replace placeholders)
- `templates/project-config.template.yaml` — template used for programmatic initialization
- `templates/bmm-workflow-status.template.yaml` — status template with rules

Getting started:
1. Edit `bmad/config.yaml` and set `project_name`, `project_type`, and `project_level`.
2. Review `docs/bmm-workflow-status.yaml` and adjust statuses as needed.
3. Optionally, use the `bmad-master` skill or your own script to generate filled templates.

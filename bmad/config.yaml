  mandatory : See `bmad/references/PROJECT.md` for the full project specification. Extracted constraints:
  - Stack: Svelte 5 + SvelteKit, TypeScript
  - Database: SQLite (drizzle-orm)
  - Auth: better-auth (server-side)
  - Testing: vitest + Playwright
  - Layout descriptor (canonical): src/bmad/references/sive-layout.html
  - Workflow for creating layouts and components:
    1. Define the new layout or element in `sive-layout.html` with english comments.
    2. Run `pnpm run gen:mockups` to generate mockup components in `lib/elements/mockups`.
    3. Use the mockups as references to create new components in `lib/elements` with svelte-5 standards.

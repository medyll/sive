# Sprint 2 Plan

## Sprint Goals
1. Transition from the "Planning" phase to the "Solutioning" phase.
2. Define the solution architecture and finalize technical specifications.
3. Prepare for the "Implementation" phase by identifying key tasks and dependencies.

## Tasks to Complete During the Sprint

### Solution Architecture
- Define the high-level architecture for the BMAD system.
- Identify core components and their interactions.
- Document the architecture in `bmad/artifacts/architecture.md`.

### Technical Specifications
- Finalize the technical specifications for the solution.
- Ensure alignment with the PRD and architecture.
- Update `bmad/artifacts/tech-spec.md`.

### Sprint Preparation
- Break down the "Implementation" phase into actionable tasks.
- Prioritize tasks based on dependencies and importance.
- Create a detailed task list for the next sprint.

## Expected Outcomes
- A well-defined solution architecture.
- Comprehensive technical specifications.
- A clear and actionable plan for the "Implementation" phase.

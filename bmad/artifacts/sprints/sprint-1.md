# Sprint 1 – Auth MVP

**Duration:** 2 weeks (flexible start/end)
**Capacity:** TBD (dev-days / story points)

## Sprint Goal
Deliver the authentication data model, auth architecture, and a working login flow integrated with better-auth so the MVP can authenticate users.

## Stories

| ID | Epic | Title | Points | Priority | Assignee |
|---:|---|---|---:|---|---|
| S1-01 | Auth | Define auth data model (users, sessions, providers) | 3 | Must | — |
| S1-02 | Auth | Create auth architecture doc + review (data model + adapter) | 3 | Must | — |
| S1-03 | Auth | Implement basic login UI + server flow | 2 | Must | — |
| S1-04 | Auth | Integrate better-auth adapter & DB migrations | 3 | Must | — |
| S1-05 | QA | Unit tests for auth logic | 2 | Should | — |
| S1-06 | QA | E2E Playwright tests for login flow | 3 | Should | — |
| S1-07 | Docs | Update README and docs for auth setup | 1 | Could | — |

**Total (points):** 17 (adjust to capacity)

## Dependencies
- Architecture: auth data model (S1-01/S1-02) must be final before S1-04 migrations.
- Env secrets for third-party providers (if applicable).

## Definition of Done
- All Must stories completed, reviewed and merged
- Unit + integration tests passing
- E2E smoke test for login passes in CI
- Documentation updated with setup and migration steps

## Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Data-model changes mid-sprint — Mitigation: freeze schema after S1-02 review and create follow-up migration story if needed
- Risk: External provider credentials unavailable — Mitigation: provide local-mock fallback and document env variables

## Ceremonies
- Sprint Planning (2h), Daily standups (15m), Mid-sprint demo, Sprint Retro (1h)
